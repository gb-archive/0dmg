I migrated to the Rust 2018 edition in the Nightly compiler build.

https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/edition-guide/2018/transitioning/to-rust-2018.html

This was a little rocky, including hitting a new compiler crash where I should have had an error message (see [rust#51798](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51798)), but it's nicer, and I took the oppertunity to break the code into a few distinct packages, and add a few doc tests, and enable Travis. Giving me these badges:

[![zerodmg package on crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/zerodmg.svg?style=flat-square&label=zerodmg+bin)](https://crates.io/crates/zerodmg)

I haven't made any emulator progress, but it was nice to play with this part of Rust's tooling, and to be on the 2018 path.
