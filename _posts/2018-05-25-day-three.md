# Day Three

I've been comparing my log output to the disassembled boot ROM. It would probably be nifty and convenient to just have my output include the assembly encoding of the instructions I'm executing. At first it was jibberish, but there aren't *that* many assembly instructions and I'm going to be working with them so I shouldn't forget.

Something like the following. Put the assembly commands on the left, followed by the initial instruction pointer index, then the original machine code, and finally the values of any relevant registers and memory locations. Using the assembly-style `$` hex prefix instead of `0x`.

    asm                 ; i     ; machine code ; registers
    LD C, $11           ; $000F ; $0E1123      ; C' = $11
    BIT 7, H            ; $0012 ; $BCFF        ; H = 0xFA  ; Z' = true
    JR NZ, -5           ; $0014 ; $FFFF        ; Z = false

Here I'm using `C'` to indicate a new value for the `C` register. I like this, but I think the z80 architechture actually has additional registers with names including `C'`, so that may be confusing. Consider something else like `C₀` and `C₁`. Or I could be explicit about the change, like `C = 0 -> 1`.
