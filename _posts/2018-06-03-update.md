I've done an initial implementation the `ly` graphics register, which can be read to check which scan line we're currently at. This gets us to the point where the boot ROM repeatedly loops to wait for the next frame. This means we're currently printing tens of thousands of log messages for the same few instructions, between every set of meaningful output. This is horribly slow and barefuly usable; our initial logging approach is at its breaking point.

I'm thinking something like this:

- keep a circular buffer of the last 1024 instruction results (`operation::Execution`) in memory.
- once every 2^20 cycles (once per second), or some interval, format and print out the last 128 instructions, like we currently print all of them.

I would also like to start syncing in-game clock with the real clock, by sleeping when it gets ahead, because that sounds easy.
