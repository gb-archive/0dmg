It has been hard to split up the Game Boy into different pieces, without those pieces all depending on each other. For now, it's much simpler for reference/pointer management to put the entire Game Boy system state in a single struct. This sounds gross at first, but read on.

Different functionality is in different "traits" (a trait is like an interface). So the `CPU` trait includes methods for reading from registers, and the `cpu` module provides the `CPU` trait and implements it for `GameBoy`. (The implementation of a trait for a type can be separate from other methods for that type.)

So if you import `GameBoy`, by default only its `.run()` method is exposed. You need to manually choose to import traits, like this:

    use emulator::cpu::CPU;

in order to expose other methods like `.z_flag()`.

Traits can only contain methods, not fields, so this doesn't encapsulate the data from each component. To do that, we also split up the struct's data into sub-types that are defined alongside the traits in other modules. 

    pub struct GameBoy {
        cpu: CPUData,
        mem: MemoryData,
        aud: AudioData,
    } 

This allows, for example, our `cpu` module to always keep all of the fields in `CPUData` private, while exposing its methods to anybody who imports it trait.

It's a bit of a weird design partially born out of confusion, but it's workable.
