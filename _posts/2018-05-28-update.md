# Update

Got back to implementing instructions. The first few were pretty simple variations of what we already had. But the code is writing to a new section of memory: the audio registers and buffers! But I'm not planning to support that yet, so I can get away with:

    } else if 0xFF10 <= address && address <= 0xFF26 {
        println!("  ; skipping write to sound control memory -- not implemented");
    }

How do I want to do I/O -- initially just meaning video output -- for this thing?

To me, the simplest thing is probably a tiny web server that pushes frames over a websocket. A real GUI framework might be neccessary for a real emulator, but we don't need much. <https://ws-rs.org/guide>
